## Project Background
Tunes is a social media platform with music at the forefront - users link their Spotify accounts, then connect with those close to them who have similar taste. Tunes will help users find friends, bandmates, or even romantic partners with a strong common musical interest, then give them a platform to interact and share events through. We plan to market towards markets that are densely populated with young people (such as a city or college campus) that would maximize the chance of finding similar users who are geographically close to meet in real life, as well as utilize the event sharing functionality to spread the word about musical or social events happening near the user. 

### Connect With Others 
Upon registering your account, Tunes will provide you with a weighted list that takes into account musical similarity and geographic closeness to determine users it thinks you will be most likely to be friends with, then gives you a way to connect with them, or search for more people based on their location or interest in a specific style of music. We plan to implement robust privacy settings to ensure users can only be located if they desire, and additionally offer different levels of search filtering to help users locate each other. 

### Find Things to Do Together
Once you find your friends, Tunes will help you connect outside of the site by advertising events (anything from musical concerts to friendly get-togethers and parties) through the site. To keep with the site's theme, users will be able to specify what type of music will be featured, or what is currently playing if the event is going on at that time. 

### Check Your Map! 
Tunes will unite all of these features into an interactive map display, which will dynamically render users and events near you based on your location and settings specified. Users will be able to browse the map at any time to find others also listening to music at the same time, and locate events going on near them to attend.
